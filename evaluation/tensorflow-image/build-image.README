How the process of constructing and exporting a docker image works.

To build a tensorflow image run the following with the appropriate tensorflow script:

docker build --tag ${IMAGE_NAME} --build-arg  PYTHON_SCRIPT=${SCRIPT} .


To export the image tar to be using by our sev machine use:

docker save ${IMAGE_NAME} > ${IMAGE_NAME_TAR}


The sev machine will use the following command to import it:

docker load < ${IMAGE_NAME_TAR}
